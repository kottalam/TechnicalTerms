## Introduction and Purpose

The lack of technical terminology in Tamil is a significant impediment to writing and translating 
scientific and technological literature. For a concept lacking a technical term, different authors
create different terms to suit their immediate needs. The technical terms created this way do not
follow a uniform style. Some of them happen to be ஜ ந்தமிழ் words, some of mixed origin, and
some others English words. If all authors were to follow a uniform terminology, and if scientific
books consistent with each other were to appear in Tamil, we should create a list containing all
technical terms and writers should adopt a convention to use the same list. The purpose of this
work is to create such a list and submit to scholars as a proposal.

There may be many technical dictionaries in Tamil already. This is not another technical
dictionary. The purpose of this work is different from that of a dictionary. The purpose of a
dictionary is to define words and explain meanings. If there is ambiguity in a word, a dictionary
explains all meanings of the work. In contrast, the purpose of this work is to present a Tamil
technical word corresponding to an English technical word and create a list of words in a such
a way that ambiguities do not arise. A dictionary lists different words in use in different
disciplines for the same concept. This book attempts to propose a single word to represent a
concept in many areas. A dictionary lists and explains the meanings of words already in use.
This book proposes words that should become in common use.

In natural languages spoken by people it is common that a word has different meanings in
different contexts. This is a common property of all languages including English. However,
technical words used in science have definite definitions as much as possible. Here it is rare that
a single word has many meanings or there are many words for a single concept. In zoology,
botany, and chemistry, there are strict rules to assign a unique name to a species. Given this
situation, it is not only possible but also necessary to create a definite list in Tamil as well.

It is essential that such a list be complete. For every English technical word to be searched, the
list should yield the corresponding Tamil technical word. But the total space of science and
technology is very broad. Our list can be considered complete only if it reaches every nook and
corner of that space. Moreover, all scientific disciplines are developing areas. New technical
words are being formed in English and other languages. Our list should also get updated
accordingly on a continuous basis. Conquering the breadth and growth of science and achieving
completeness is a monumental task. It is doubtful whether it is feasible. But we must try.
Monuments have been built in the past! Since scientific fields are broad, deep, and open,
completeness is not achievable; but it can be approached. Mathematically, completeness is a
limit that can be asymptotically approached arbitrarily closely.
